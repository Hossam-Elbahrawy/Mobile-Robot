Control of Mobile Robot
================

Introduction
------------
This repo contains Arduino code to control a mobile robot by implementing go-to-goal and obstacle-avoidace behaviours using 2 method: Gain matrix contoller and PID controller, IR encoders (odometry modle) are used as feedback to the controllers

Hardware
--------
* Mobile Robot
* Arduino Uno
* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
* l293M motor driver
* 2 IR encoders
